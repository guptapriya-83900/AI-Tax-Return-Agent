# AI Tax Return Agent Prototype

This project is a working prototype of an AI-powered tax return assistant. It allows users to upload W-2, 1099-INT, and 1099-NEC forms, extracts the necessary tax information, calculates tax liability based on 2024 IRS rules, and generates a filled IRS Form 1040.

## Features

- PDF Upload (W-2, 1099-NEC, 1099-INT)
- OCR-based Tax Info Extraction
- Tax Calculation Logic
- PDF Generation of Form 1040

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo and create a virtual environment.
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run: `python app.py`

## Next Steps

- UI Improvements
- Support for more forms (Schedule C, 1098)
- IRS Sandbox Integration
